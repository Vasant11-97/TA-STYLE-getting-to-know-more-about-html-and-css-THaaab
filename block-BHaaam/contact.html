            Most contact pages are designed with function in mind.

            They slap an email address, phone, and location on a plain background and call it a day.

            But basic contact pages don’t inspire visitors to reach out and connect.

            Other pages make it easy to contact the company – which is awesome.

            Except, that can also drive up customer service costs.

            So what makes the perfect Contact Us page?

            An awesome Contact Us page finds just the right balance between making it easy to reach the company and sharing resources users can use to answer their questions right away.

            Keep reading to discover 39 examples of Contact Us pages that go beyond the basics and will, hopefully, inspire you to take your site to the next level.
